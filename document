Here are two ways technology can aid forest management:

1. **Digital forestry tools:** Digital forestry tools can help save time, money, and achieve a deeper understanding of forests. For example, Purdue University's Integrated Digital Forestry Initiative (iDiF) is developing digital forestry tools to improve the sustainability and resilience of forests ¹.

2. **Geospatial technology:** Geospatial technology can be used to better understand and monitor deforestation, conservation, and environmental degradation. For example, geospatial technology can be used to track changes in forest cover over time, identify areas at risk of deforestation, and monitor the effectiveness of conservation efforts ².
